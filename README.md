# Defend.Outer.Space

A linux command prompt space invaders created using C code. It is made specifically to be used within a puTTy client on a linux server.

This is my first game created using the C language and I honestly learned alot. I learned how much hard work actually goes into 
creating interesting and fun programs. I learned the limits of arrays and dealt with many a segmentation fault. Although it is still
very buggy and rather unstable, I cherish it's infancy. I am looking forward to creating better and more complex programs in the future.
